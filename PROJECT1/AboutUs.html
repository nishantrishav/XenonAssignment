                    <p class="center">Street vendors were amongst the first to face the economic wrath of the COVID-19-induced
                        lockdown. With a severe dip in daily income, street vendors lost business and livelihood sources – making
                        it difficult for them to meet ends. Pandemic-induced lockdowns further led to stall closures and a draught
                        in customer inflow, aided by the wariness of street food amidst customers, even as they began stepping out.
                        To help the street vendors, we collaborated with the Government of India (GoI) in February 2021
                        (during the first COVID-19 wave) to help revive the street vendors’ business by providing them online access
                        to a wider customer base. GoI had launched a specialised scheme called the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s
                        AtmaNirbhar Nidhi Scheme or PM SVANidhi Scheme. Funded by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA),
                        the initiative was aimed to facilitate working capital loans, incentivise regular repayments and increase digital
                        transactions for street vendors. Zomato saw this collaboration as an opportunity to empower and digitise the
                        vendors and create economic independence for them. We signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry
